## How to Play

1. **Draw a Card**: A card appears with an event title and picture, but without the year.
2. **Place on Timeline**: Drag and drop (or click) to place the card in the correct chronological order relative to the existing cards.
3. **Score & Lives**:
   - **Correct**: The year is revealed, and your score goes up!
   - **Incorrect**: You lose a life (out of 3), and the card automatically slides to its correct position.
4. Play as long as you have lives remaining and try to get the highest score!
